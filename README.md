# STAT-432-Basics-of-Statistical-Learning
Analysis projects at UIUC class of STAT 432
For the Fall 2020 semester, this repository contains the 4 analysis from the given data.

## Data
- 'Heart Diesease'
- 'Credit Fraud'
- 'MLB Pitching'
- 'Image Recognition'


## Learning Objectives
Our hope is that the process of completing these analyses will help you see how to put what we have learned this semester into practice.
Specifically, after completing these analyses and receving feedback, we hope that students are able to:

  - **formulate** practical, real-world, problems as machine learning problems.
  - **implement** learning methods using a statistical computing environment.
  - **evaluate** effectiveness of learning methods when used as a tool for data analysis.
  - **communicate** analysis results in a concise and meaningful manner.
  
Beyond that, we hope you use these analyses as an opportunity for exploration. 
Hopefully the foundation we have created throughout the semester will give you the confidence to try some things 
we only briefly discussed, or did not discuss at all!
